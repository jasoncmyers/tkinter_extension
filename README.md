# Tkinter Extensions
This project contains severeal extension classes to the Python Tkinter library, filling gaps that I have found while building user interfaces.

##Placeholder
At present, this is a list of the needs rather than the actual components. TODO.

## Components
* Numpy array image importer
* Entry field with more robust support for validation, changing tooltips and button color, and control of the output value
* Image display class (undecided on inherriting from Label of Canvas) that supports automatic rescaling on window resize and allows zooming and panning of the image, as well as fitting to the current viewport.
